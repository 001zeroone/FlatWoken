FlatWoken
=========

Official *FlatWoken* icon theme source repository (alpha/beta/testing) releases.

The *FlatWoken* project is developed by **Alessandro Roncone** (aka *alecive*). It is is meant to be a complete set of icon themes for Linux **AND** Android. If you'd like to use and/or modify these icons for your own purposes, please consider the fact that the iconset is free to use *as long as* its use is not conveying any monetary income. If it does, we can arrange easily. Regardless of the use, I'd like to know if and how my icons are used, and I'd like to receive some sort of credit for it! Nothing crazy, though: just a quick note on the bottom or your website with my email/website is sufficient :)

Design Guidelines
--------------

*FlatWoken* project is derived from the popular *AwOken* icon theme. It's freely inspired by its minimalist approach, even though it is basically a revision with an eye toward flat design. 

*FlatWoken* icons are currently divided in two different icon sets:

- *FlatWoken* is the main branch. It's supposed to enclose all the design ideas behind the project: flat, long-shadow icons enclosed in squared frames with rounded corners. The only choice diverging from the flat design guidelines is the shadow given to the squared frame: it is meant to make the icon stand out from any background in which it can be placed in.
- *FlatWokenMin* is a more minimal reinterpretation of its bigger brother. Basically, it follows a different approach for making the icons stand out from the background (no more shadows but a 3d-ish flat effect on the bottom and the right size) *plus* it reinterprets some icons in order to push on the minimalistic approach. Furthermore, the icon in itself is completely white, whereas the squared frame is supposed to enclose the main color(s) of the original icon. Currently I'm mainly focusing on the design of *FlatWoken* icon theme, but I update also once in a while.


Installation
--------------

Firstly, a git installation should be up and running on your machine (and you should have at least some basic knowledge related to git). Secondly, remember that this method doesn't work for KDE (but it works for any GNOME/XFCE/LXDE installation) Then, follow these simple steps:

- Open a terminal window
- `cd` in your Download/Programming/Git folder
- type `git clone https://github.com/alecive/FlatWoken.git`
- `cd` into the `FlatWoken` folder just appeared
- `mv` the folders called `FlatWoken` and `FlatWokenMin` into your `~/.icons` directory (if this directory doesn't exist, simply create it).
