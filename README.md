FlatWoken
=========

Official *FlatWoken* icon theme source repository (alpha/beta/testing) releases.

The *FlatWoken* project is developed by **Alessandro Roncone**. It is is meant to be a complete set of icon themes for Linux **AND** Android, so please don't release your own remastered version of this icon theme for any of these platform. If you'd like to use and/or modify these icons for your own purposes, please notice that the iconset is free to use *as long as* its use it's not conveying any monetary income. If it does, we can arrange easily. Regardless of the use, I'd like to know if and how my icons are used, and I'd like to receive some sort of credit for it.

Design Guidelines
--------------

*FlatWoken* project is derived from the popular *AwOken* icon theme. It's freely inspired by its minimalist approach. The design contemplates flat, long-shadow icons enclosed in squared frames with rounded corners.

*FlatWoken* icons are currently divided in two different icon sets:

- *FlatWoken* 
- *FlatWokenMin* is supposed to be a more minimal reinterpretation of its bigger brother. Currently I'm mainly focusing on the design of *FlatWoken* icon theme, but I'll update also this sooner or later.
